The project requirements is to have a client and server program that allows 
interactions using RPC techniques, allowing them to send and prompt 
information from each other.The first step in this venture was to 
establish a connection between the two parties. Once a connection was 
established, the client can transmit anything to the server 
until the client typed 'Over'. The server socket, once the client sends a message
was able to receive and display what the message was. Once the client side 
typed 'Over', the server side would ensure all connections were terminated.
